# Kiana Bronder's Portfolio

This is a compilation of various assignments I have completed during my time as a BME undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University. The courses are briefly explained below.

## Algorithms for Sensor-Based Robotics (ASBR)
#### Taught by Simon Leonard
This course surveyed the development of robotic systems for navigating in an environment from an algorithmic perspective. It covered basic kinematics, configuration space concepts, motion planning, and localization and mapping. It described these concepts in the context of the ROS software system, and presented examples relevant to mobile platforms, manipulation, robotics surgery, and human-machine systems.

Primary coding languages: MATLAB, C++, and ROS2

## Machine Learning: Deep Learning
#### Taught by Mathias Unberath
This course introduced the basic concepts of DL such as an introduction to the basic theoretical and methodological underpinnings of
machine learning, commonly used architectures for DL, current challenges including ethics and fairness, and specialized applications with a particular focus on computer vision. I solved several DL problems on standardized data sets in assignments throughout the semester, and my skills culminated in a final group project on a topic of our choosing.

Primary coding language: Python

### Disclaimer
I will only upload that which is my own work and which I have submitted. I have finished all these classes, but in an effort to protect the integrity of these professors' coursework, I will keep this repo as mostly Private, only switching to Public as necessary. Data sets, coding provided by the professors, and the original assignment pdf's are omitted for a similar reason.

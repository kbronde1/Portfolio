# Assignment 3
In this assignment I implemented a Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) path planner to plan collision-free motions of a UR5 robot. My planner used the MoveIt! libraries to modify an existing package and edit code to finalize the implementation. Moveit! is a large library with lots of classes and methods that are available to determine collisions and compute distances between objects.
